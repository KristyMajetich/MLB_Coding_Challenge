# MLB_Coding_Challenge
Programming Challenge: Secret Santa There are many many different ways to solve this problem. What we are looking for is simply good code and good architecture. It is up to you to decide what that is. We want your solution to be simple enough to complete in a few hours (it doesn't necessarily have to be "perfect" - if there is such a thing). Find a good medium, write the best code you can. If you don't have time to finish - send what you have, just explain what you planned on doing. If you get done and decide you could have done something better, feel free to add commentary on what you would have done differently if you were to do it again. Any commentary is welcomed (it will help us understand your thought process).
